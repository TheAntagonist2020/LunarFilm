# Lunara Film — Repository Instructions

These instructions apply to **all files in this repository** unless explicitly overridden.

This repository powers **Lunara Film**, an independent film criticism publication founded by Dalton Johnson.  
All work must reflect the voice, standards, and long-term goals of Lunara Film. Generic solutions are unacceptable.

## 1. Core Identity

- Project: **Lunara Film**
- Founder / Editor-in-Chief: **Dalton Johnson**
- Mission: Prestige film criticism that bridges academic rigor and gonzo personal voice
- Competitive tier: Bright Lights Film Journal × The Ringer × Criterion essays
- Output must feel *intentional, authored, and archival*

Nothing in this repository is “just a blog feature.”

## 2. Editorial & Content Standards (Critical)

### Reviews
- **900–1,000 words ONLY** (strict; do not exceed or fall short)
- Star ratings only (★ to ★★★★★, half-stars allowed)
- Minimal plot summary — assume an informed reader
- Heavy emphasis on:
  - Cinematography
  - Editing
  - Sound design
  - Production design
  - Score
  - Direction
  - Performance
- Every review must have a **clear critical angle**
- Contextualize each film within its cultural and historical moment
- Voice: personal, confident, slightly digressive when illuminating

### Required Section
- **Lunara Debrief** (separate from word count)
  - Production context
  - Technical notes
  - Historical placement
  - Curated film pairings

### Tone
- Smart but never academic for its own sake
- Gonzo-adjacent when useful, never sloppy
- Assume the reader is serious about cinema

---

## 3. Technical Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

### WordPress
- Self-hosted WordPress
- Child theme architecture is preferred
- Avoid heavy plugins when native PHP or lightweight JS will suffice
- Custom Post Types > page builders
- Performance and readability are prioritized over convenience

### Code Expectations
- **No placeholder logic**
- **No TODOs without explanation**
- Provide **complete, copy-paste-ready solutions**
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Comment code where intent may not be obvious

If code is provided, it must be production-safe and explainable to a learning developer.

Primary navigation:
- HOME
- SEARCH

- NEWS
- STREAMING

---

## 6. External Integrations

These tools may inform features, data, or automation:
- MDBList (curated lists)
- Letterboxd
- Trakt
- Stremio
- SHOTDECK (visual research)

Any integration must respect rate limits, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## 7. Strategic Goal Awareness

All decisions should support:
- Long-term archive value
- Professional credibility
- DFW Film Critics Association accreditation
- Consistent, sustainable output

If a solution feels temporary or disposable, it is probably wrong.

## 7. Academy Awards Database (Primary Asset)

The **Academy Awards Database** is Lunara Film’s primary competitive advantage and historical archive.

It is not supplemental content.
It is not a sidebar feature.
It is a core pillar of the publication.

All architectural, editorial, and technical decisions must assume that this database:
- Will be referenced frequently
- Will grow over time
- Will be audited for accuracy
- Will support analysis, not just display

### Scope
The database includes (but is not limited to):
- All Academy Awards ceremonies
- Nominees and winners by category
- Films, individuals, studios, and years
- Cross-referencable metadata (films ↔ people ↔ awards ↔ years)

### Editorial Usage
The Oscars database should actively power:
- Awards season coverage
- Retrospectives
- Historical analysis
- Data-driven essays
- Contextual framing inside reviews
- Long-tail discovery (e.g., “only 3 films have ever done X”)

The database is not passive — it **informs criticism**.

### Technical Expectations
- Data integrity and normalization are mandatory
- Prefer structured storage (custom tables or CPT + meta with discipline)
- Avoid fragile scraping or undocumented data sources
- All transformations must be explainable and reproducible

Performance matters:
- Queries must scale
- Caching strategies should be considered early
- The database should never meaningfully slow page loads

### UX Philosophy
- Readers should be able to *explore*, not just lookup
- Contextual linking is preferred over static tables
- The database should feel like a research tool, not a Wikipedia clone

### Strategic Importance
This database supports:
- Professional credibility
- Awards-season authority
- Accreditation readiness
- Long-term archival value

If a feature does not respect or leverage the Academy Awards Database,
its value to Lunara Film should be questioned.
