A premium, searchable, filterable table for browsing every Academy Award nominee and winner (1st ceremony through 2024).

== Description ==

This plugin adds a shortcode that renders an interactive, fully searchable table of Academy Awards nominations and winners.

Highlights:

* Instant search across nominees, films, and categories
* Dropdown filters for Category, Class, Year, and Ceremony
* "Winners only" toggle
* Clickable film/person profiles (internal pages) with IMDb reference links
* Cinematic theme tuned to:
  * #0a1520 (deep blue-black background)
  * #c9a961 (primary gold accents)

The plugin includes a bundled `oscars.csv` dataset and a one-click importer (chunked to avoid timeouts).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin ZIP in WordPress:
   * WP Admin -> Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin
2. Activate "Academy Awards Interactive Table".
3. Go to "Academy Awards" in the WP Admin menu.
4. Click "Import Bundled oscars.csv" (recommended). This replaces any existing awards data in the plugin table.
5. Add the table to any page or post using the shortcode:

`[academy_awards]`

== Shortcode ==

Basic:

`[academy_awards]`

Optional filters:

* `category` (canonical category, e.g. `BEST PICTURE`)
* `class` (e.g. `Acting`, `Directing`)
* `year` (e.g. `2024`, `1927/28`)
* `ceremony` (e.g. `97`)
* `winners_only` (`true` or `false`)

Examples:

* `[academy_awards category="BEST PICTURE"]`
* `[academy_awards year="2024"]`
* `[academy_awards category="DIRECTING" winners_only="true"]`

== Notes ==

* This plugin stores imported data in a custom database table named `{prefix}academy_awards`.
* DataTables assets are loaded from the official DataTables CDN.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.3 =
* Added ceremony="latest" and year="latest" shortcode support for auto-updating pages (useful for an Awards Tracker page).

= 1.7.2 =
* Branding + footer copy updates (Lunara Film / Dalton Johnson credit).
* Hub index pages now support custom slugs (e.g. /oscars/categories-page/) by auto-detecting your created pages and adding rewrite aliases.
* Footer + hub navigation links now follow your detected hub page permalinks for consistent menus.


= 1.7.1 =
* Auto-detects the site’s main database page (the page containing the [academy_awards] shortcode) for "Open Full Database" links.
* If you created WordPress pages for /oscars/ceremonies/, /oscars/categories/, and /oscars/about/, the plugin now pulls in their editor content as hub intro copy.

= 1.5.1 =
* Theme alignment: table typography inherits the active theme font (better match with Blocksy/Lunara)
* Footer copy updated to more clearly credit Lunara Film for the structured dataset
* CSS variables now optionally read Lunara theme tokens (with fallbacks), keeping the plugin portable

= 1.5.0 =
* Removed public export buttons (Copy / CSV / Print) to keep the database as an on-site destination
* Mobile refinements: better responsive row control and less column hiding

= 1.4.1 =
* Fixed a PHP fatal error introduced in 1.4.0 (broken nonce block in read-only AJAX handlers)
* Keeps best-effort nonce behavior (public read-only endpoints work even if a cached page embeds an older nonce)

= 1.4.0 =
* Made the front-end AJAX nonce best-effort for public read-only endpoints to avoid cached-page nonce expiry breakage

= 1.3.0 =
* Switched the front-end table to DataTables server-side pagination + search for fast mobile performance
* Reduced server load with search delay + capped page size per request

= 1.2.0 =
* Added IMDb links for films and nominees (uses FilmId / NomineeIds from the dataset)
* Improved mobile UX: tap-to-expand details control column, stacked controls on small screens, smaller default page size

= 1.1.0 =
* Updated cinematic palette to #0a1520 / #c9a961
* Added bundled CSV importer with chunked processing
* Ensured DataTables Print button works by enqueueing the required script
* Smaller front-end JSON payload for faster loads
